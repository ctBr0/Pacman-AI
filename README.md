Contains: <br />
Pathfinding algorithms such as uniform cost search and A star search to construct paths for Pacman to traverse through a generated maze<br />
Adversarial search algorithms such as minimax and expectimax for maze navigation while avoiding ghosts<br />
Value iteration and Q-learning to train Pacman to choose between avoiding ghosts and consuming more pellets and more<br />
Bayesian networks to model joint probability distributions when Pacman (this time as a Ghostbuster) hunts down the ghosts
